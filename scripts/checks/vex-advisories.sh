# The VEX drift gate: the published OpenVEX document must be exactly what the
# generator produces from `deny.toml` + `security/vex/rust-advisories.toml`.
#
# Two failure modes it exists to catch, both of which have precedent in
# FerroEHR's history of second lists that nothing read:
#
#   1. An advisory is accepted in `deny.toml` and no justification is published,
#      so a downstream scanner sees an unexplained finding while the argument
#      sits in a TOML comment nobody downstream reads. (The generator refuses;
#      this gate is where that refusal reaches CI.)
#   2. The JSON is hand-edited, or the prose changes without regeneration, and
#      the published document quietly stops matching the gate it claims to
#      describe.
#
# Mutation-proven in both directions: adding an ignore to `deny.toml` without a
# prose entry fails, and touching one byte of the generated JSON fails.
#
# What this gate CANNOT see: whether either side still describes reality. An
# ignore and its justification agree perfectly right up until a dependency
# upgrade resolves the advisory, at which point both are stale and both still
# pass here. `scripts/checks/advisory-exceptions.sh` is that half, and it runs in
# the cargo-deny job, which is where the graph is resolvable.
#
# A document with no statement is valid: it says no advisory is accepted,
# which is the truth while deny.toml ignores none, and the release path keeps
# one fixed file to publish. Its `statements` must still be an array.
#
# Usage: scripts/checks/vex-advisories.sh [--self-test]
# VEX_DIR moves the VEX directory (default security/vex) and VEX_GATE the
# gate file (default deny.toml); the generator reads the same variables.
